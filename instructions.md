# Milestone Project 2

## Brief

In this project, you’ll be building a frontend-only website using the technologies that you have learned throughout Interactive Frontend Development. You can either choose to use one of the three example briefs below, or you can use your idea for the website.

1. CREATE A SINGLE PAGE APPLICATION THAT RELIES HEAVILY ON ONE OR MORE APIS

    * Create a site that calls on the Google Maps API and/or the Google Places API (or similar) to allow users to search for their next holiday destination. You'll want help your users:

        * Select a destination city
        * Find tourist attractions
        * Find accommodation
        * Find bars and restaurants
    
    * Provide search results in a manner that is visually appealing for your user (by drawing on the skills you have learned in User-Centric Frontend Development)


2. CREATE A MEMORY GAME

    * Build a simple single-player memory game inspired by Simon. Check out this short [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yqj76Q4jJ4) and [Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(game)) to understand the rules of the game
    
    * Provide details in your README.md of the logic you have used to build your game as well as an explanation of how you tested your logic


3. CREATE A DATA DASHBOARD

    * Build a data dashboard that visualizes a dataset of your choice
    
    * Your data can be stored locally (e.g., in a js file) or sourced from an API
    
    * Visualise your data using D3.js and dc.js


4. CREATE YOUR OWN PROJECT

    If you choose to create your project, the scope should be similar to that of the example brief above. If you want some ideas, please ask your mentor for advice and direction.

## Guidelines

Use the following guidelines when developing your project:

* Create a Single-Page Application (SPA)
* Incorporate links or buttons to allow your user to navigate the site and reset/control the site functionality
* Whenever possible, strive to use semantic HTML5 elements to structure your HTML code better.
* Make sure your site is as responsive as possible. You can test this by checking the site on different screen sizes and browsers. Please note that if you are building a data dashboard, only your chart containers are expected to be responsive. Charts using D3.js are not responsive as they are designed for desktop or large-screen viewing.
* We advise that you write down user stories and create wireframes/mockups before embarking on full-blown development.
* The site can also make use of CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap, just make sure you maintain a clear separation between the library code and your code.
* You should conduct and document tests to ensure that all of your website’s functionality works well.
* Write a README.md file for your project that explains what the project does and the need that it fulfills. It should also describe the functionality of the project, as well as the technologies used. Detail how the project was deployed and tested and if some of the work was based on other code, explain what was kept and how it was changed to fit your need. A project submitted without a README.md file will FAIL.
* Use Git & GitHub for version control. Each new piece of functionality should be in a separate commit.
* Deploy the final version of your code to a hosting platform such as GitHub Pages.


### PLAGIARISM

It is each student’s responsibility to ensure that when they include (directly or indirectly) the work of others that this contribution is fully and adequately acknowledged and documented.

You are encouraged to ask your mentor/tutor for advice about your project work, but note that your project code should not include any code written by others unless it is explicitly credited to them with a comment above. Any such code provided by your mentor/tutor would not contribute to your assessment. Failure to attribute credit to code that isn’t yours will be considered as plagiarism and will result in a failing grade.

## README file

Recommended structure for your README.md file:

* As a mandatory part of the submission, your project must have a readme file named README.md, in markdown format, that will describe all aspects of your project.

* This [link](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/readme-template/blob/master/README.md) provides an official example of an expected structure for your readme file, that if followed in its entirety should get you 4 marks out of 5 on the assessment. To get the maximum 5 marks, you would need to include all of the parts below and also tailor the readme to your own particular project, providing any additional relevant information useful to your users and other developers who may want to contribute to the project.
